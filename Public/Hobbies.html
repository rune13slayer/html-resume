<h2>University Activities</h2>
  <p>
    As was said in the overview, I joined a LOT of extracurricular stuff during High School and during College. 
    One of the highlights was when I joined Indayog Dance Varsity in University of the Philippines Manila. 
    I was a performer in three of the varsity's annuaal concert. I was also part of the team that competed in 
    Ego Supreme Crew Wars 2 - College Eliminations (2016). We made it to the finals! Watch our performance here in <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4G7gXg0LM target="_blank">YouTube</a>!

    Another highlight during my College days was when I joined our Department's Choir: Up Manila Biorhythm. We're not super professional, 
    maybe treat it as a Singing/Choir Club. We always sang the opening ceremonies, prayers, and/or doxology of our department's program. 
    One of the culminating activites would be singing in the College Graduation. That was ecstatic!

  I like rogue-lite games, DOTA, FPS games, Helldivers, you name it! I just want to have fun and explore the endless repository

  Also indicated in the overview is my love for coffee. Again, I'm considered as an amateur but I'm so intrigued by the 
  intricacies of coffee. I like to taste all the types that I encounter! I also like mixing up cocktails and liquors/liquers. 
  I'm no means an alcoholic. I just like the unique taste cocktails provide!
