  <h2>2023: NCII Barista (GBI Training and Assessment Center - Parañaque)</h2>
  <p>
    My most recent accomplishment. I started my coffee journey when one of my friends introduced me to pour-over coffee
    in one of the famous Specialty Coffee shops in the region. Ever since, I've watched how baristas do it, both face-to-face and in YouTube (POVs).
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately my certificate's already expired since I wasn't able to officially work as a Barista or anything coffee-related 
    since I found a better paying job. But that didn't stop me from growing! My friends are a lot more involved with coffee and I've
    joined them in their journey in tasting different kinds of beans --- planted, processed, and roasted uniquely.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though I've already learned a lot, I'm pretty sure I'm only scratching the surface when it comes to coffee. Below are some photos of my journey so far.

  <h2>2012-2016: Bachelor of Science in Biology (College of Arts and Sciences, University of the Philippines - Manila)</h2>
  <p>
    As was described in the overview, I graduated BS Biology in UPM-CAS, with a General Weighted Average (GWA) of 1.76 --- Where 1 is the highest and 5 is the lowest.
    I almost graduated with honors! A grade of 1.75 or higher is needed to graduate with honors! 
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't super regret it though, since 
    I intentionally did not focus on my studies that time, but instead explored A LOT. I joined both a Dance Varsity and our very own
    department's choir! I was a part of the dance team that competed for inter-collegiate/university dance competition, and we made it to finals!
  </p>
  <p>
    And of course, this is also the time where we accomplished our Undergraduate Thesis, which is also published thanks to our mentor!

  <h2>2008-2012: Consistent Entry (all year levels) in the batch top 10 (Parañaque Science High School)</h2>
  <p>
    Science High Schools are regarded as among the top schools in the country. As the name suggests, the curriculum focuses
    on science subjects such as Chemistry, Physics, Math, etc. But the curriculum does not exclude the arts and humanities and provide
    the same quality education for those areas too.
  </p>
  <p>
    During those times, I've strived to at least make myself among the top 10 students of the batch each year and at the same time still 
    explore extracurricular activities such as Pageants, Talent contests, Religious events, etc.
