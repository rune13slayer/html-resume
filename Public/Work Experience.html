    This is my current job (2025). A bulk of my task is filtering properties using a third-party software/website 
    and an already made-up Python program. I also organize data in MS Excul using various formula such as vlookup, xlookup, 
    if, countif, unique, concatenate, textjoin, proper, trim, left/right, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also work on Wordpress website from time to time. We showcase properties for open-house in a Wordpress website and edit 
    the details accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, I update a number of profiles such as google, facebook, instagram, and airtable. I update posts, emails, schedules, and 
    listings according to a Master List that is setup.

    The Remote-Job scene was still booming at this time since the pandemic. This is also a remote job and a part-time at that.
    Our main task as a Data Entry Associate is basic and simple: to search and encode contact numbers and emails using manual search and also using 
    a third party lead generator. The main challenge here was to do it within the specified time limit. We worked around 3-4 hours before the 
    Outreach Associates will log in --- the people who will contact those leads that we just gathered.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately our department underwent furlough and eventually the unit got dissolved.

    My first night-shift remote job. It was farely easy as I was mostly just tasked to manually send messages one-by-one 
    to potential leads, which is about 2000 leads a day. At the end of the shift, I summarize those who were interested and those 
    that did not want to be contacted anymore and report it to my manager.
  </p>

  <p>
    From time to time, I was also tasked with super amateur photoshop/editing of presentations/pamphlets using InDesign and/or GIMP.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unforunately, operations had to stop around March 2020 due to the pandemic.

    Took this job as a freelancer/part-timer to start earning. I think this was my first job and honestly, it
    was enjoyable. I didn't continue as I had other personal plans.
